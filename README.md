Hi I'm dom111 and I'm a developer from the UK.

I'm currently really enjoying TypeScript and am learning it through rewriting old work and experimenting with some of the fun aspects. You can see the progress of the code from [my civ-clone repository](https://github.com/dom111/civ-clone) to [the new civ-clone organisation](https://github.com/civ-clone).

I like to play code golf sometimes which I used as a tool to understand Perl better which I needed to use at a previous role. I'm also a big fan of polyglots and enjoy learning different programming languages whenver I get the opportunity.
